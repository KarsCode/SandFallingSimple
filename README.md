# Interactive Sand Simulation with p5.js

This project is an interactive sand simulation created with **React** and **p5.js**. Inspired by the amazing work done by **The Coding Train**, this project simulates a grid-based sand environment where particles fall and interact based on mouse movement. The color and behavior of the sand particles change dynamically, creating an engaging visual effect.

## Features

- **Interactive Sand**: Create and manipulate the sand particles with your mouse.
- **Dynamic Color**: The sand particles change color over time.
- **Responsive Design**: The canvas automatically adjusts to fit different screen sizes, making it suitable for both mobile and desktop devices.
